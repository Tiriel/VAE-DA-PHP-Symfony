                <h1>Présentation du concept</h1>
                <p>Obi-Wan Kenobi...Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time...a long time.
                    I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead. Oh, he's not dead, not...not yet. You know him!
                    Well of course, of course I know him. He's me! I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.
                    Then the droid does belong to you. Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting...
                    I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.<br />
                    <br />
                    Threepio! Where am I? I must have taken a bad step... Can you stand?
                    We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return. I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke.
                    There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for. No, you're not. What kind of talk is that?
                    Quickly, son...they're on the move.</p>

                <h1>Présentation de l'association</h1>
                <p>You got her warmed? Yeah, she's comin' up. No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
                     Hey, are you awake? Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again. Come on, General, let's move.
                    Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody? All set. Here we go again. All right, hang on.<br />
                    <br />
                    Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father? Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest. Yoda, I must know. Your father he is.
                    Told you, did he? Yes. Unexpected this is, and unfortunate... Unfortunate that I know the truth? No.
                    Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you.
                    Well, I'm sorry. Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression.
                    The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.<br />
                    <br />
                    You're free of the carbonite. Shhh. You have hibernation sickness. I can't see. Your eyesight will return in time.
                    Where am I? Jabba's palace. Who are you? Someone who loves you. Leia! I gotta get you out of here.
                    What's that? I know that laugh. Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked.
                    It's not my fault. It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but now you're Bantha fodder.
                    Look... Take him away! Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be a fool!
                    Bring her to me.</p>
