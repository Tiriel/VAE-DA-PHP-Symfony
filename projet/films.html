                <p>Admiral. Yes, Captain I think we've got something, sir. The report is only a fragment from a probe droid in the Hoth system, but it's the best lead we've had.
                    We have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy. I want proof, not leads! The visuals indicate life readings.
                    It could mean anything. If we followed every lead... But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human forms.
                    You found something? Yes, my lord. That's it. The Rebels are there. My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements.
                    It could be smugglers, it could be... hat is the system. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them.
                    Set your course for the Hoth system. General Veers, prepare you men.</p>

                <p>Ben...Ben, please! Ben. Leia! Hear me! Leia! Luke...We've got to go back. What? I know where Luke is.
                    But what about those fighter? Chewie, just do it. But what about Vader? All right, all right, all right.
                    Bring my shuttle. Look, someone's up there. It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll get under him.
                    Lando, open the top hatch. Okay. Easy, Chewie. Lando? Okay, let's go. Oh, Leia. All right, Chewie.
                    Let's go. I'll be back.</p>

                <p>You must come along now, Artoo. There's really nothing more we can do. And my joints are freezing up.
                    Don't say thing like that! Of course we'll see Master Luke again. He'll be quite all right, you'll see.
                    Stupid little short-circuit. He'll be quite all right. Sir, all the patrols are in. There's still no contact from Skywalker or Solo.
                    Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope.
                    Your Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight. The shield doors must be closed. Close the doors.
                    Yes, sir.</p>

                <p>Oh. No one to meet us. I don't like this. Well, what would you like? Well, they did let us land.
                    Look, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. Trust me. See? My friend. Keep your eyes open, okay?
                    Why, you slimy, double-crossing, no-good swindler! You've got a lot of guts coming here, after what you pulled.
                    How you doing, you old pirate? So good to see you! Inever thought I'd catch up with you again.
                    Where you been?</p>
